This Bluetooth wrapper is available here: https://github.com/brookpatten/PebbleSharp.Mono.BlueZ

It has not been merged to PebbleSharp yet because it depends on changes to Mono and dbus-sharp that have not been released yet.  
Once those changes are released and more widely available I will merge it here.
